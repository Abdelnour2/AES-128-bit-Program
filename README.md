# AES-128-bit-Program

Welcome to my AES project - This was a project I made during my masters in a cryptography course.

To run the program (Quick Note I'm using VS Code as my code editor), simply press the triangle button on the top right of your screen or open a new terminal and type "python main.py" and the program will run.

Once the program opens, you will be welcomed with a main menu asking you to enter your choice:
Do you want to encrypt? type 1 or encrypt (case is not sensitive)
Do you want to decrypt? type 2 or decrypt (case is not sensitive)
Do you want to exit the program? type 3 or exit (case is not sensitive)

If you wanted to encrypt or decrypt, you will be asked to enter the plaintext/ciphertext and the key as a 128-bits hex string
And that's it, you will see all the process of encrypting/decrypting

I hope you like my project!
